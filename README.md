# Luna
Luna is a simple CLI application for scraping websites.

## Usage

Currently `scrape` is the only available command. It takes a website url as the argument.
 
```
$ luna scrape https://some.site.com
```

## Plans
- Figure out how to make it easily installable and usable for anyone
- Add flags for parsing certain parts of a site, like main content, headings only, etc.
- Add flags for output in different file formats like .txt, .pdf, .cvs
- Think of a fun new name for the project (luna-cli already exists)
- Write some tests

## Why?
I've finally become curious enough to dive into a new language, GO. I figured a web scraper is practical and simple enough that I could work through GO's docs to figure it out. So far it's been great! 

I'm also building an AI web app that has me pondering different creative ways to provide useful inputs to LLMs, specifically from the world wide web.
