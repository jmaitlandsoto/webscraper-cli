# Luna
Luna is a CLI application for scraping websites.



## Usage {#usage}

Currently `scrape` is the only available command. It takes a website url as the argument.
 
```
$ luna scrape https://some.site.com
```

## Plans {#plans}
- Figure out how to make it easily installable and usable for anyone
- Add flags for parsing certain parts of a site, like main content, headings only, etc.
- Add flags for output in different file formats like .txt, .pdf, .cvs
- Think of a fun new name for the project (luna-cli already exists)
